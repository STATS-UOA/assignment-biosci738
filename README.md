## Template repository (repo) for GitHub Classrooms BIOSCI738 workshops

Well done you got this far!

This template repo is set up as a basic [RStudio Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects). It contains the basics for you to get started on the analysis of the included datasets (in the [data](https://github.com/STATS-UOA/assignment-biosci738/tree/master/data) folder). Head to the [script](https://github.com/STATS-UOA/assignment-biosci738/tree/master/script) folder and find the `.Rmd` file that has the basics for writing a document in [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

Each week you'll be expected to write-up your analysis of the data (based on what we've covered in the lectures) using plots, code-chunks, and whatever else you fancy. Remember it should be easy to follow and informative! You are then expected to **push** your changes for grading (due midday the Wednesday following the workshop).
