## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r name}
my_name <- "Harry"
my_name
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r rnorm, echo=FALSE}
plot(rnorm(1:1000))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Messy Data: Workshop 1

Load the `tidyverse` packages

```{r tidyverse, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Note that the `message = FALSE` parameter stops messages from `R` appearing in our document. 

### DNA markers

Data from [Identification and evaluation of age-correlated DNA methylation markers for forensic use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497316300461?casa_token=qPk_jTQ4H5EAAAAA:Tu4wBtVyHzRAsB_7k3uIXsTqcsVucoVi7AvN54Evrue-Bw8CmK6CHraK0mjS-G4O7XF50V_cAI0)

Read in the genomics data, remember this is set as a `.Rproj` so the path is **relative**

```{r genomics}
genomics <- read_csv("../data/dna_markers.csv")
glimpse(genomics)
```

### Herbicide data

Data from [Comparing biocontrol and herbicide for managing an invasive non‐native plant species: Efficacy, non‐target effects and secondary invasion](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13691)

Read in the data, it's a little more niggly as 

 + it's in a multi sheet `.xlsx` file 
     + we'll need the `read_xlsx()` function from the `readxl` package. One quick way of calling this function is by using `readxl::read_xlsx()`, see below
     + use the `sheet` argument to choose which one you want to read in
  + to get to the *data* we have to skip a few rows! In sheet 1 we have to skip 5, and keep the headers (use the `skip` argument to specify the number of rows you want to skip).
  
```{r herbicide, message = FALSE}
biocontrol <- readxl::read_xlsx("../data/dicots_herbicides.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 5)
biocontrol
```
